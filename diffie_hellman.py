"""
An implemantion of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol
used to establish a key to use in AES encryption.

works as follows: a large prime p is used for the multiplicative
group mod p, g is a primtive value of said group. The server
the picks a value x from the multiplicative group mod p
and client picks value y from the multiplicative group mod p
server send client g**x and client sends server g**y
key = (g**x)**y == (g**y)**x

K should be hashed before being used by any other system, e.g. as a key in AES
